# Copilot Operating Manual (READ FIRST)

This repo uses 2 roles:
- **Builder** = implement/change code
- **Reviewer** = review diffs/PRs and produce GitHub-ready comments

## Required Knowledge Sources (MUST)
When making decisions, use sources in this order:
1) This README
2) Project code
3) Local skills in `./.agents/skills/` (ONLY the allowed ones below)

### Allowed Frontend Skills (ONLY)
- `./.agents/skills/vite/`
- `./.agents/skills/typescript-advanced-types/`
- `./.agents/skills/tailwind-css-patterns/`
- `./.agents/skills/accessibility/`
- `./.agents/skills/frontend-design/`

Do NOT use other skills unless explicitly asked.

## Global Rules (MUST)
- If requirements are unclear: ask questions before coding.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing patterns.
- Strict TypeScript. Avoid `any`. If unavoidable, justify.
- No new dependencies unless required.
- Never hardcode secrets/keys/tokens. Use env vars and update `.env.example`.

## Security Rules (Frontend)
- Assume browser code is public. Never embed secrets.
- Do not log sensitive data (tokens/PII).
- Prevent XSS (avoid unsafe HTML; sanitize if required).
- Handle network errors; show user-safe error messages.
